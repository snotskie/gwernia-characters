  - name: Finely Tuned Lute 🌟⿻

  - name: Scroll of Frozen Doom ⿻
    effect: The scroll's creator makes a violent Delayed Attack against the target when this item is used and again on each of the target's turns. The standard amount for these Attacks is 5, and buttons that would prevent movement from these Attacks are instead removed from the Endeavor. Once the target successfully Defends against one of these Attacks, this effect ends. Until then, the target can take no actions, as they are frozen to their soul, witnessing their own demise. A target with the Horde tag or a relevant Immunity tag automatically succeeds these Checks. Once used, this scroll dissolves into cold ash.
